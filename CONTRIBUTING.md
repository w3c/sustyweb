# Contributing

This repository is being used for work in the **W3C Sustainable Web Design Community Group**, governed by the [W3C Community License
Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). To make substantive contributions,
you must join the [CG](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/).

## Overview

This repository is used to develop content for the Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSGs), as well as any supplementary documents.

## Collaboration

We welcome content from individuals as well as group efforts and understand that this may pose difficulties for those either unfamiliar with pull requests (on a technical level) or with collaborative efforts (wishing to discuss progress before submitting results). In such cases, members can (if they choose) work with any open format they prefer to collaborate (referring to the specification and its supplements), and submit an issue request containing the URL to the document in question. A moderator (lead or chair) will help translate these requested updates into the living draft specification.

## File Structure

The structure of the repository has been created to ensure ease of maintenance. The base directory contains links to all of the compiled files that are public facing such as the [specification](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/), [at-a-glance](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html), [overview](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/overview.html), [laws & policies](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/policies.html), [quick reference](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/quickref.html), [STAR](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/star.html), [JSON API](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/guidelines.json) and other supplements such as our draft Test Suite.

When you contribute to our repo, you **MUST** only make changes to documents within the "ig" folders (the sources). Once a PR submission has been reviewed by our group (for quality control purposes), it will either be accepted, or rejected, or further discussion will be required (an issue can be raised for example). Once a PR has been accepted it will be visible within the living draft documents immediately. When enough issues have been collated to warrant a release publication, the necessary documents will be exported through ReSpec into their final HTML form and will replace their static namesakes in the base directory to be versioned as the next public release. Release notes will also be generated by a chair who will verify all submissions before publication.

You will notice duplication within the content of our work (as the JSON API for example must reflect the specification). This work is not auto-generated so while we appreciate it if individuals choose to make adjustments to all affected files as required, time commitments may not allow for everyone to do so. As such, if you can only update a single document, as part of the approval process, a moderator (lead or chair) will update all necessary documents to ensure parity with your change.

## Pull Requests

If you would like to contribute towards this specification, our primary method is through Pull Requests (PRs).

Pull requests (PRs) should be made against the main branch.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

## Issues

If you cannot submit a pull request, or if you cannot provide a direct solution, the preferred method is to create a [new issue](https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/new) with your public comments. You can also comment on any issue threads on [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/). You could provide comments on technical errors (bugs) you have uncovered, new guidelines or success criteria you believe should be added, questions you have about existing or future content or an idea for a direction or feature we could utilize.

Please check that your question hasn't already been posted first, and provide as much detail as possible (if you have a solution or content to add, it would be very helpful). We're all volunteers so please keep this in mind and try to be civil when commenting about our work.

If filing issues in GitHub is not feasible, email our open discussion group [public-sustyweb@w3.org](public-sustyweb@w3.org) ([comment archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sustyweb/)).

## Credit

All contributors will receive credit (in the specification and our GitHub release notes) if their feedback and ideas make it into the document. Certain exclusions will apply such as those who do not provide their full names or those whose feedback is deemed as invalid, duplicate, or general questions that don't add to the specification or its supplements.
