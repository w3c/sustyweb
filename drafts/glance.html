		<section id="abstract"> <!-- Abstract -->
			<p>This page provides a paraphrased summary of the Web Sustainability Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Sustainability Guidelines">WSG</abbr>) 1.0. For the normative technical specification, see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/</a>.</p>
			<p>It aims to be a helpful entry point for individuals and stakeholders who have an interest in digital sustainability and the work undertaken by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/sustyweb">Sustainable Web Design Community Group</a>.</p>
			<p>While this document does provide a quick summary of numerous key aspects of the WSG specification, it must be established that it in no way should be used as a replacement for following the guidelines and success criteria as laid out in the complete, long-form specification. Reasons for this include that this summary is neither intended to be in-depth nor feature-complete. Therefore, its role as an overview to help orientate stakeholders to the specification's purpose in no way provides conformance to Web Sustainability criteria.</p>
			<p>Help improve this page by sharing your ideas, suggestions, or comments via <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<section> <!-- Context -->
				<h3>Context</h3>
				<p>The digital industry is now responsible for between 2-5% of global emissions [[ICT-IMPACT]] [[EUC]] [[8BT]], more than that of the aviation industry. Since the Paris Agreement, average web page sizes have increased by over 70% on desktop and 140% on mobile [[PAGE-WEIGHT]]. Between 2015 and 2021, internet visitors increased by 60%, whilst internet traffic increased by 440% [[DATA]]. In essence, if the Internet were a country it would be one of the top five polluters. [[COUNTRY]]</p>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Summary -->
				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>The Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) 1.0 explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, website creators, product owners, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers. The guidelines are in line with both the Sustainable Web Manifesto [[MANIFESTO]] and Manifesto for a Humane Web [[HUMANE]].</p>

				<h3>Highlights</h3>
				<p>Knowing where to start, especially with a document as long and dense as the WSGs is quite a challenge. You may wish to scan through a supplement such as our <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/quickref.html">quick reference</a> which provides a checklist-based overview of every guideline. Or if you just want a couple of important tasks you can dive right into them. If so, consider the below as a few of our highlights (though please note, that this doesn't reduce the importance of the others).</p>
