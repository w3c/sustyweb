			<p>Sustainable Tooling And Reporting (<abbr title="Sustainable Tooling And Reporting">STAR</abbr>) 1.0 provides information, examples, and metrics data to complement the Web Sustainability Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Sustainability Guidelines">WSG</abbr>) 1.0 specification. Within this supplementary document, you will find implementation advice (for external groups wishing to incorporate sustainability in their work), an evaluation methodology (for testing conformance), a categorized series of techniques (potential implementations and case studies), and a test suite (metrics data on impact and machine automation capability).</p>
			<p>As with the <abbr title="Web Sustainability Guidelines">WSGs</abbr>, these features have been inspired by the work of the Web Accessibility Initiative ([[WAI]]). They have also been curated with a Web sustainability methodology, with the goal of better understanding the digital landscape's role in reducing harm to the wider ecosystem (regarding people and the planet).</p>
			<p>For the normative technical specification, see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/</a>.</p>
			<p>Help improve this page by sharing your ideas, suggestions, or comments via <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd" class="override"></section> <!-- Ignore -->
		<section> <!-- Implementation -->
			<h2>Implementation Advice</h2>
			<p>The following section provides advisory guidance for other specification writers and external groups wishing to incorporate digital sustainability within their work (such as <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Working and Community Groups). We are primarily a group dedicated to fostering sustainable change in Web technologies associated with the creation of websites and applications. While it is outside of our group's scope to conduct horizontal reviews of other group's specifications, we may request or accept requests to collaborate with or assist in coordination with other groups to implement sustainable change.</p>
			<section> <!-- Considerations -->
				<h3>Considerations</h3>
				<p>The WSGs have a broad appeal, designed to impact a wide range of Web technologies and related infrastructure as appropriate. With this in mind, when first starting to look to incorporate sustainability within a body of work you may find that certain guidelines more than others will apply to practices.</p>
				<p>When designing any fledgling body of work it's worth considering the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Can a sustainability policy be put in place to vet work appropriately?</li>
					<li>If any guidelines are applicable, can they be included as "hard and fast rules"?</li>
					<li>If not (due to a conflict), can this be resolved without impacting the benefit?</li>
					<li>Can research to identify any sustainability benefits that are yet undiscovered be undertaken?</li>
					<li>Is education for consumers on a work's environmental impact being provided?</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="note">
					<p>When creating specifications or industry-specific documents, cross-reference to specific WSG guidelines that are appropriate for a body of work to connect elements of content to applicable sustainability goals.</p>
					<p>Create new sustainability guidelines that are explicitly targeted for a technology (that may be too niche to be included within the WSGs). This would provide additional Success Criteria for an audience to meet.</p>
					<p>If you do wish to create additional targeted guidelines, please first consult the <abbr title="Sustainable Web Design Community Group">SWD-CG</abbr> as we may be able to include them within the main WSGs or provide guidance to avoid conflicts with other existing guidelines.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Methodology -->
				<h3>Methodology</h3>
				<p>With the above considerations taken into account, a good next step is to consider sustainability within content and treat sustainability as any other impact target (such as accessibility or performance) by trying to drive change through metrics data. If research exists to back a particular technique as more performant, it's likely to be more sustainable. Often there will be cases where evidence does not exist as Web sustainability is an evolving field and as such, a common sense approach (considering the variables that can impact people and the planet) will be the best method if metrics data cannot be provided to identify the most sustainable option.</p>
				<p>Every body of work will have its approach to this and a progress over-perfection methodology is preferred (as doing something is ultimately better than waiting for an ideal fix), but as a general consideration for those who are creating documents that are relied upon by large numbers of individuals, the <abbr title="Planet, People, and Prosperity">PPP</abbr> model which doesn't just account for emissions and the environmental impact but also and human factors and issues surrounding good governance are an ideal template to work from. In the context of the Internet this accounts for everyday (but important) factors such as performance, accessibility, privacy by design, security, and reducing waste which all as a by-product have an environmental impact.</p>
				<p>It's also important to note that different bodies will have their sustainability challenges, for example, those working on native <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> are more likely to encounter hardware resource consumption (energy usage), whereas language standards will be more considerate of implementors, accessibility, and improving developer workflows. As such, it's worth coordinating with other groups with aligned goals and discussing their sustainability approaches to align work and help improve theirs, accounting for different variables.</p>
				<p class="note">Providing sustainability guidance within work can be presented in many ways. One option is to integrate it within existing guidance or specifications (amending the content). Another is to provide notes or in-page sections dedicated to sustainability providing coverage. Or to gently guide individuals into the subject, a dedicated supplement that will be adapted or merged into the specification at the next major version (giving individuals time to adapt) could be created.</p>

		<section> <!-- Evaluation Methodology -->
			<h2>Evaluation Methodology</h2>
			<p>Evaluating the extent to which a website implements the Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) is a process involving several steps. The activities carried out within these steps are influenced by many aspects such as the type of website (e.g. static, dynamic, responsive, mobile, application, etc.); its size, complexity, and the technologies used to create the website (e.g. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, etc.); how much knowledge the evaluators have about the process used to design and develop the website; and the main purpose for the evaluation (e.g. to issue a sustainability statement, to plan a redesign process, to perform research, etc.).</p>
			<p>This methodology describes the steps that are common for comprehensive evaluation of the extent of websites and applications to implement WSG 1.0. It highlights considerations for evaluators to apply these steps in the context of a particular product or service. It does not replace the need for quality assurance measures that are implemented throughout the design, development, and maintenance of websites or applications to ensure their sustainability conformance. Following this methodology will help evaluators apply good practice, avoid commonly made mistakes, and achieve more comparable results. However, in the majority of situations using this methodology alone, without additional quality assurance measures, does not directly result in a sustainable product or service that meets the WSG 1.0 success criteria and guidelines.</p>
			<p><strong>This methodology does not in any way add to or change the requirements defined by the normative WSG 1.0 specification</strong>, nor does it provide instructions on feature-by-feature evaluation of web content. The methodology can be used in conjunction with techniques and examples for meeting WSG 1.0 success criteria, such as the techniques documented within this STAR supplement, but does not require this or any other specific set of techniques.</p>
			<p>This methodology is intended for people who are experienced in evaluating Web sustainability using WSG 1.0 and its supporting resources. It provides guidance on good practice in defining the evaluation scope, exploring the target website, selecting representative samples from websites where it is not feasible to evaluate all content, auditing the selected samples, reporting the evaluation findings, and if necessary - implementing sustainable change. It does not specify particular web technologies, evaluation tools, web browsers, or other software to use for evaluation. It is also suitable for use in different evaluation contexts, including self-assessment and third-party evaluation.</p>
			<section class="notoc"> <!-- Purposes for this Methodology -->
				<h3>Purposes for this Methodology</h3>
				<p>In many situations it is necessary to evaluate the sustainability of a website or application, for example before releasing, acquiring, or redesigning the product or service, and for monitoring the sustainability of a website or application over time. This methodology is designed for anyone who wants to follow a common approach for evaluating the compliance of websites to WSG 1.0. This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Web consultants who want to analyze and report the sustainability  conformance of websites or applications, to inform website owners.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability evaluation service providers who want to evaluate products and services to validate sustainability compliance.</li>
					<li>Website designers and developers who want to evaluate the sustainability compliance of their websites or applications to monitor or improve them.</li>
					<li>Website owners, procurers, and suppliers who want to learn about the sustainability compliance of their websites.</li>
					<li>Web compliance and quality assurance managers who want to ensure that they meet quality and policy requirements.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability monitoring activities are used to benchmark and compare sustainability compliance over time.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability researchers and environmental advocates or activists who want to explore sustainability compliance practices.</li>
					<li>Web sustainability trainers and educators who want to teach approaches for evaluating the sustainability of websites and applications.</li>
					<li>Webmasters, content authors, designers, developers, and others who want to learn more about web sustainability and evaluation.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Usage and Scope -->
				<h3>Usage and Scope</h3>
				<p>This methodology is used to perform thorough evaluations of websites and applications using WSG 1.0. Before this, it may be useful to undertake a preliminary evaluation to identify obvious sustainability issues and to take a progress-over-perfection approach to tackling guidelines holistically (though note that such evaluations won't be as robust as a thorough evaluation).</p>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Evaluators and Usage -->
					<h4>Evaluators and Usage</h4>
					<p>Different expertise may be required to evaluate a website or application, as such, one of the below or a combination of these at different stages of the project may assist with understanding and evaluating the sustainability of a website or application.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Required Expertise</strong> Users of this methodology are assumed to have a solid understanding of how to evaluate web content using WSG 1.0 along with a reasonable understanding of sustainable web design and development, how web sustainability affects Internet infrastructure and business practices, and how sustainability issues affect both people and the planet. This includes a reasonable understanding of existing web technologies; and evaluation techniques, tools, and methods to identify sources of emissions, how to measure them accurately, and how to remedy issues that occur. In particular, it is also assumed that users of this methodology are deeply familiar with the WSG 1.0 supplementary documents</li>
						<li><strong>Combined Expertise (Optional)</strong> This methodology can be carried out by an individual evaluator with the required expertise, or a team of evaluators with collective expertise. Using the combined expertise of different evaluators may sometimes be necessary or beneficial when one evaluator alone does not possess all of the required expertise.</li>
						<li><strong>Involving Users (Optional)</strong> Involving people who are affected by real-world complications of sustainability may help identify digital issues that are not easily discovered by expert evaluation alone. While not required for using this methodology, it may sometimes be necessary for evaluators to involve real people from a wide variety of backgrounds during the evaluation process.</li>
						<li><strong>Evaluation Tools (Optional)</strong> This methodology is independent of any particular web sustainability evaluation tool, web browser (user-agent), and other software tool. While some sustainability checks in the WSGs are not fully machine-testable, evaluation tools can significantly assist evaluators during the evaluation process and contribute to more effective evaluation. For example, some web sustainability evaluation tools can scan entire products and services to help identify relevant pages for manual evaluation as well as identify those issues that fall under testability criteria. Tools can also be used to assist during manual (human) evaluation of sustainability checks, including those that aren't machine-testable.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This methodology is designed for evaluating both websites and applications. This includes organizations, entities, persons, events, products, and services. Websites and applications can include publicly available or internal websites; applications, intranets, online shops, dedicated mobile websites, isolated sections of a larger website, or internationalization pages (on a subdomain for example). This methodology can apply equally to any collection of materials, regardless of whether it is a part of a larger project or a dedicated entity of its own.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Principle of Website Enclosure -->
					<h4>Principle of Website Enclosure</h4>
					<p>When a target website or application is defined for evaluation, all pages, states, and functionality within the scope of this definition must be considered for evaluation. Excluding such aspects of a website from the scope of evaluation would likely conflict with the WSG 1.0 success criteria and conformance requirements or otherwise distort the evaluation results.</p>
					<p>Example of Website Enclosure</p>
					<ul>
						<li>index.html</li>
						<li>news.html</li>
						<li>services.html</li>
						<li>portfolio.html</li>
						<li>about.html</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In the above example, if a personal portfolio website in its entirety is defined as the target for evaluation, then all of the depicted areas are within the scope of the evaluation. This includes any aggregated and embedded content such as images of work undertaken, assets that are considered apart of the website, interactive materials created, maps to an office (if one exists), including when such parts originate from third-party sources. If only a specific website area, is defined as the target for evaluation then all the parts of this area are within the scope of the evaluation. One example could be to evaluate all of the portfolio items, as well as the individual web pages that are common to the work undertaken by the practitioner.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Particular Types of Websites -->
					<h4>Particular Types of Websites</h4>
					<p>This methodology applies to a broad variety of website and application types. The following provides considerations for particular situations, noting that products and services may combine several aspects. Thus the following list is non-exclusive and non-exhaustive:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Small Websites:</strong> Small websites that are comprised of fewer pages place a lot of their sustainability impacts upon fewer pages. Some examples of this include personal portfolios, blogs, fan sites, and project websites. Small websites may be connected to a larger website, but treated as an individual and separable entity for evaluation.</li>
						<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> Web applications are generally composed of dynamically generated content and functionality (see web page states). Web applications tend to be more complex and interactive. Some examples of web applications include webmail clients, document editors, and online shops. Web applications may be part of a larger website but can also constitute a website of their own in the context of this methodology. That is an individual and separable entity for evaluation. Due to the many possibilities of generating content and functionality in web applications, it is sometimes not feasible to exhaustively identify every possible web page, web page state, and functionality. Web applications will typically require more time and effort to evaluate, and they will typically need larger web page samples to reflect the different types of content, functionality, and processes.</li>
						<li><strong>Website in Multiple Versions:</strong> In some cases websites may have clearly separable areas where using one area does not require or depend on using another area of the website. For example, an organization might provide an extranet for its employees only that is linked from the public website but is otherwise separate, or it might have sub-sites for individual departments of the organization that are each clearly distinct from one another. Such separable areas can be considered as individual websites for evaluation. Some websites also provide additional or different content and functionality depending on the user (typically after a log-in). This additional content and functionality is generally part of the essential purpose and functionality of the website and is thus not considered to be a separable website area.</li>
						<li><strong>Website with Separable Areas:</strong> Some websites are available in multiple versions that are independent of one another in use, that is, using one version does not require or depend on using another version of the website. For example, a website may have versions of a website in different languages that meet this characteristic. Usually, each such website version has a different set of URIs. Such website versions can be considered as individual websites for evaluation. Websites using responsive design techniques (i.e. adapting the presentation according to user hardware, software, and preferences) as opposed to redirecting the user to a different location are not considered to be independent website versions.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> Responsive design techniques adjust the order, flow, and sometimes behavior of the content to best suit the device on which it is used. For example, to adjust the content and functionality according to the size of the viewport, screen resolution, orientation of the screen, and other aspects of a mobile device and the context in which it is being used. In this methodology, such changes to the content, functionality, appearance, and behavior are not considered to be independent website versions but rather web page states that need to be included in the evaluation scope. As such, considerations for mobile devices, operating systems, and assistive technologies need to be taken for websites using responsive design techniques during the evaluation process.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Situations and Contexts -->
					<h4>Situations and Contexts</h4>
					<p>This methodology is designed to be flexible to facilitate its applicability in different situations and contexts. The following considerations apply to particular situations and contexts for an evaluation:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Self-Assessment:</strong> In-house evaluators and evaluators who are part of the development process have the benefit of internal access to the team, environments, documentation, and codebases.</li>
						<li><strong>Third-Parties:</strong> Independent external evaluators will have less access to internal processes and information, but can come with expertise and experience that may not exist within internal teams.</li>
						<li><strong>Evaluating During Development:</strong> While evaluation must take place during both ideation and implementation, it's important to be aware that such evaluations can become obsolete, and constant reevaluations should occur during the development process to maintain currency.</li>
						<li><strong>Third-Party Content:</strong> Third-party content is not under the control of the website or web service providers. WSG 1.0 provides specific considerations for the conformance of such type of content. In such cases, evaluators will need to determine whether such content is regularly monitored and repaired.</li>
						<li><strong>Re-Running Website Evaluation:</strong> Website evaluation, according to this methodology, may be re-run after a short period; for example, when issues are identified and repaired by the website owner or website developer, or periodically to monitor progress.</li>
						<li><strong>Large-Scale Evaluation:</strong> Carrying out mass evaluation of many websites or applications, for example for national or international surveying, is typically carried out by primarily using automated evaluation tools. Relatively few web pages undergo full manual inspection. Such evaluations do not usually address the necessary qualitative depth of conformance review per product or service for which this methodology is designed.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Evaluation Procedure -->
				<h3>Evaluation Procedure</h3>
				<p>This section describes the stages and activities of an evaluation procedure. The stages are not necessarily sequential. Also the exact sequence of the activities carried out during the evaluation stages depends on the type of application or website, the purpose of the evaluation, and the process used by the evaluator. Some of the activities can overlap or may be carried out in parallel.</p>
				<p>There are five sequential steps defined in this section:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Define the Evaluation Scope;</li>
					<li>Explore the Target Website;</li>
					<li>Test or Sample the Website;</li>
					<li>Audit the Selected Pages;</li>
					<li>Report the Evaluation Findings.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Evaluators should proceed from one step to the next, and may return to any preceding step in the process as new information is revealed to them during the evaluation process.</p>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Internal Knowledge -->
					<h4>Internal Knowledge</h4>
					<p>Due to the requirements of sustainability reporting and the success criteria contained within the WSGs, in order to conform to certain aspects of the specification it may be required to obtain or have access to internal knowledge of the website or application or a business behind the product or service. If such access is possible, this knowledge should be used by evaluators in accordance to any policies in-place regarding data use. If access however is not available or cannot be provided, the use of publicly available data may serve as a general estimation of comparability; though the accuracy of results may be in question. In addition, in cases where no replacement for data can be found, conformance evaluators should aim to identify other methods of meeting success criteria or identify the lack of knowledge as a failure point (until such a time that the organization can disclose the information publicly).</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Machine Testability -->
					<h4>Machine Testability</h4>
					<p>While many of the success criteria in the WSGs will withstand machine testing (automation) without human intervention, others cannot be reproduced without manual examination. In such cases, to assist with a large volume of pages, rather than sampling a subset of the website or application (which could bias the results due to the potential for missing important pages), creating a semi-automated structure around human testability to assist with such tasks through tooling (such as the use of a wizard interface) may help reduce pinch points in the evaluation process.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Step 1: Define the Evaluation Scope -->
					<h4>Step 1: Define the Evaluation Scope</h4>
					<p>During this step the overall scope of the evaluation is defined. It is an important step as initial exploration of the target application or website may be necessary to better know specifics (and to ensure common expectations) of the product or service and the required evaluation.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Define the Scope of the Website:</strong> During this step the web pages (and states) that are in scope of the evaluation are defined. To avoid later mismatches of expectations between the evaluator, commissioner, and readers of the resulting evaluation report, it is important to define unambiguously what aspects of the website or application are within its scope. Documentation of URIs are recommended where possible and to list aspects of the website that support its identification such as third-party content and services, or content that may have a different web address but is still considered to be part of the target website.</li>
						<li><strong>Define the Target:</strong> Because the WSGs favor a progress-over-perfection approach to conformance, it does not use any strict levels for compliance in meeting the guidelines. As such, during the evaluation process, evaluators should set defined targets based on a level they believe is achievable between client and the workers involved in making the website or application sustainable.</li>
						<li><strong>Define a Sustainability Support Baseline:</strong> Depending on the type of website or application being developed, it may not always be possible to implement every aspect of the WSGs (or they may not always be applicable to every situation). WSG 1.0 does not pre-define which combinations of features and technologies must be supported as this depends on the particular context of the website or application, the web technologies that are used to create the content, and the user agents currently available. During this step the evaluator in consultation with the website owner (and or commissioner) and developer determines the minimum level of sustainability implementations or improvements to be established over a given period (or as a starting point in first-cases). It should be noted that setting a baseline doesn't imply that such expectations cannot be exceeded with new goals and including further targets to reach.</li>
						<li><strong>Define Additional Evaluation Requirements (Optional):</strong> An evaluator or commissioner may be interested in additional information beyond what is needed to determine the extent of compliance to WSG 1.0. This may include submitted reports of issues, analysis of use-cases or interactions, descriptions of solutions beyond the scope of the evaluation, or reporting templates. Such additional requirements should be clarified early on and documented, and reported as such in any resulting report that is produced.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Step 2: Explore the Target Website -->
					<h4>Step 2: Explore the Target Website</h4>
					<p>During this step the evaluator explores the target website or application to be evaluated, to develop an initial understanding of the product or service and its use, purpose, and functionality. Much of this will not be immediately apparent to evaluators, in particular to those from outside the development team. In some cases it is also not possible to exhaustively identify and list all functionality, types of web pages, and technologies used to realize the website and its applications. The initial exploration carried out in this step is typically refined in the later steps as the evaluator learns more about the target website. Involvement of website owners and website developers can help evaluators make their explorations more effective.</p>
					<div class="note">
						<p>Carrying out initial cursory checks during this step helps identify web pages that are relevant for more detailed evaluation later on. For example, an evaluator may identify web pages that seem to be lacking sustainable features and note them down for more detailed evaluation later on.</p>
						<p>To carry out this step it is also critical that the evaluator has access to all the relevant parts of the website. For example, it may be necessary to create accounts or otherwise provide access to restricted areas of a website that are part of the evaluation. Granting evaluators such internal access may require particular security and privacy precautions.</p>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Identify Web Pages of the Website:</strong> Explore the target website to identify its web pages, which will also include any states in web applications. The outcome of this step is a list of all web pages of the target website or application.</li>
						<li><strong>Identify the Variety of Web Page Types:</strong> Web pages and web page states with varying styles, layouts, structures, and functionality often have varying support for sustainability. They are often generated by different templates and scripts, or authored by different people. They may appear differently, behave differently, and contain different content depending on the particular website user and context. During this step the evaluator explores the target website to identify the different <em>types</em> of web pages and web page states. The outcome of this step is a list of noteworthy variables that may have a baring on the results on any sustainability auditing that can be used when evaluating web pages.</li>
						<li><strong>Identify Web Technologies Relied Upon:</strong> During this step, the web technologies relied upon within the website or applications technology stack should be identified. This includes base web technologies such as HTML and CSS, auxiliary web technologies such as JavaScript and WAI-ARIA, as well as specific web technologies such as SVG and PDF. The outcome of this step is a list of technologies that may contain sustainability issues of their own, or contribute towards overarching goals. Where possible, any content management system, libraries, components, or frameworks should also be mentioned as these can have sustainability implications that may need to be addressed during the evaluation process.</li>
						<li><strong>Identify Other Relevant Web Pages:</strong> Some web pages and web page states including features that are specifically relevant for improving the sustainability of your website or application. The outcome of this step is a list (with relevant explanations and information) regarding how such implementations benefit a product or service's visitors and users.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Step 3: Test or Sample the Website -->
					<h4>Step 3: Test or Sample the Website</h4>
					<p>In cases where it is feasible to evaluate all web pages and web page states of a website, which is highly recommended for websites under 1,000 pages, the "selected sample" in the remaining steps of this evaluation process is the entire website. In some cases, such as for small websites, this sampling procedure may result in selecting all web pages and web page states of a website.</p>
					<p>In cases where over 1,000 pages exist and the number of pages exceeds the ability to physically test every instance (or in cases where increased complexity reduces the capability to audit pages effectively), the evaluator selects a sample of web pages and web page states that is representative of the target website or application to be evaluated. The purpose of this selection is to ensure that the evaluation results reflect the sustainability of the product or service with reasonable confidence.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>In such samples, it must be structured in a way to include all assets and content relating to the selected web page or web page state.</li>
						<li>The sample selected should be randomly chosen (a blind method such as script selection could be used as an example) to avoid bias and should be comprised of <strong>10-20%</strong> of the total website or applications structure (for example, a website comprised of 2,000 pages could test 400 pages).</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Step 4: Audit the Selected Pages -->
					<h4>Step 4: Audit the Selected Pages</h4>
					<p>During this step the evaluator audits (detailed evaluation of) all of the web pages and web page states selected. Carrying out this step requires the expertise described in section Required Expertise.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Check All Initial Web Pages:</strong> For each web page and web page state, check its conformance with each of the defined success criteria in WSG 1.0 as denoted in <em>Step 1</em>. This includes all components of the web page or web page state, including any functionality and interactions that may affect the sustainability or state of the web page. Remember to include third-parties where necessary in processing and account for infrastructural and internal access requirements as the processing to meet success criteria requests to identify sustainability solutions occurs.</li>
						<li><strong>Non-Interfering Verification:</strong> Ensure that any existing implementations or solutions being utilized are non-interfering. This requires that remedies do not cause compatibility issues or problems with other critical aspects such as accessibility that may otherwise prevent the page from loading or being able to be understood.</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="note">There are typically several ways to determine whether WSG Success Criteria have been met or not met. One example includes the set of (non-normative) <strong>Techniques</strong> for WSG provided within STAR that documents ways of meeting particular WSG Success Criteria using testable statements that will either be true or false when applied to specific web content. While evaluators can use such documented guidance to check whether particular web content meets or fails to meet WSG Success Criteria (and include this within reports), it is not required and evaluators may use other approaches to evaluate whether WSG Success Criteria have been met or not met.</p>
				</section>

					<h4>Step 5: Report the Evaluation Findings</h4>
					<p>While evaluation findings are reported at the end of the process, documenting them is carried out throughout the evaluation process to ensure verifiable outcomes. The documentation typically has varying levels of confidentiality. For example, documenting the specific methods used to evaluate individual requirements might remain limited to the evaluator while reports about the outcomes from these checks are typically made available to the evaluation commissioner. Website or application owners might further choose to make public statements about the outcomes from evaluation according to this methodology.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Document the Outcomes of Each Step:</strong> Documenting the outcomes for each of the previous steps (including all sub-sections) is essential to ensure transparency of the evaluation process, replicability of the evaluation results, and justification for any statements made based on this evaluation. Evaluation reports should include names of evaluators, dates of the evaluation, the scope and requirements (of sustainability), the pages and state being tested along with any technologies being identified and relied upon, plus the results of sustainability issues identified and any key factors that have contributed to meeting (or failing to meet) targets in the WSG success criteria. In certain instances, it may be useful to offer a list of every failure occurrence for every web page and web page state for transparency reporting along with the causes and repair suggestions to remedy the failures.</li>
						<li><strong>Record the Evaluation Specifics (Optional):</strong> While optional, it is good practice for evaluators to keep record of the evaluation specifics, for example to support conflict resolution in the case of dispute. This includes archiving the web pages and web page states audited, and recording the evaluation tools, web browsers, other software, and methods used to audit them. A table or grid may be useful to record what was used for the different web pages and web page states audited. When such records contain sensitive information, they need particular security and privacy precautions. Records could include copies of files, assets, and resources of the web pages stated, screenshots (screen grabs), descriptions of the path to locate a page or state during a process (or information to use when testing interactive components), names and versions of tooling; or methods, procedures, and techniques used to evaluate conformance to WSG 1.0.</li>
						<li><strong>Provide an Evaluation Statement (Optional):</strong> In the majority of situations, using this methodology alone does not result in WSG 1.0 conformance claims for the target websites. Website owners may wish to make public statements about the outcomes from evaluations following this methodology. If they wish to do so, they should follow the advisory guidance provided in the WSG conformance section in order to provide a statement relating to the level of sustainability they have achieved.</li>

			<h2>WSG Techniques</h2>
			<section> <!-- Techniques Overview -->
				<h3>Techniques Overview</h3>
				<p>WSG 1.0 guidelines and success criteria are designed to be broadly applicable to current and future web technologies, including dynamic applications, mobile, digital television, etc.</p>
				<p>STAR techniques guide web content authors and evaluators on meeting WSG success criteria and guidelines, which include code examples, resources, and tests. Techniques are updated periodically to cover additional current best practices and changes in technologies and tools.</p>
				<p>The three types of techniques for STAR 1.0 are explained below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sufficient techniques</li>
					<li>Advisory techniques</li>
					<li>Failures</li>
				</ul>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Techniques are Informative -->
					<h4>Techniques are Informative</h4>
					<p>Techniques are informative, meaning they are not required. The basis for determining conformance to WSG is the success criteria from guidelines within the specification and not the techniques themselves. We also caution against requiring specific techniques or tests mentioned within this document. The only thing that should be required is meeting the WSG success criteria.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Technique Types -->
					<h4>Technique Types</h4>
					<p><em>Sufficient techniques</em> are reliable ways to meet the success criteria.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>From an author or evaluator's perspective: If you use sufficient techniques for a given criterion correctly and it is sustainable within the context of its wider application and usage, you can be confident that you met the success criterion.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>Advisory techniques</em> are suggested ways to improve sustainability. They are often very helpful and maybe a significant way of reducing emissions or meeting primary PPP objectives.</p>
					<p>Advisory techniques are not designated as sufficient techniques for various reasons such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>They may not be sufficient to meet the full requirements of the success criteria;</li>
						<li>They may be based on technology that is not yet stable;</li>
						<li>They may not be testable;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Authors are encouraged to apply all of the techniques where appropriate to best address the widest range of sustainability benefits.</p>
					<p><em>Failures</em> are things that cause sustainability issues and fail specific success criteria. The documented failures are useful for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Authors to know what to avoid,</li>
						<li>Evaluators to use for checking if the content does not meet WSG success criteria.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Content that has a failure does not meet WSG success criteria unless an alternate version is provided without the failure.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Scope and Limitations -->
					<h4>Scope and Limitations</h4>
					<p>In addition to the techniques, there are other ways to meet WSG success criteria. STAR techniques are not comprehensive and may not cover newer technologies and situations. Web content does not have to use STAR techniques to conform to WSG. Content authors can develop different techniques. For example, an author could develop a technique for an existing, or other new technology. Other organizations may develop sets of techniques to meet WSG success criteria. Any techniques can be sufficient if they satisfy the success criterion.</p>
					<p>Publication of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create content that meets WSG success criteria and conformance requirements. Developers need to be aware of the limitations of specific technologies and provide content in a way that is sustainable on multiple levels.</p>
					<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/">Sustainable Web Design Community Group</a> (<abbr title="Sustainable Web Design Community Group">SWD-CG</abbr>) encourages people to submit new techniques so that they can be considered for inclusion in updates of the STAR 1.0 document. Please submit techniques for consideration using <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Testing Techniques -->
					<h4>Testing Techniques</h4>
					<p>Each technique has tests that help:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Authors verify that they implemented the technique properly, and</li>
						<li>Evaluators determine if web content meets the technique.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The tests are only for a technique, they are not tests for conformance to WSG success criteria.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Failing a technique test does not necessarily mean failing WSG, because the techniques are discrete (that is, they address one specific point) and they are not required.</li>
						<li>Content can meet WSG success criteria in different ways other than STAR published sufficient techniques.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>While the techniques are useful for evaluating the content, evaluations must go beyond just checking the sufficient technique tests to evaluate how content conforms to WSG success criteria (considerations such as accessibility, privacy, security, etc).</p>
					<p>Failures are particularly useful for evaluations because they do indicate non-conformance (unless an alternate version is provided without the failure).</p>
				</section>
				<section class="notoc"> <!-- Using the Techniques -->
					<h4>Using the Techniques</h4>
					<p>Techniques for WSG are not intended to be used as a standalone document. Instead, it is expected that content authors will usually use our quick reference to read the WCAG success criteria and follow links from there to specific guidelines within the specification (including examples and techniques).</p>
					<p>Some techniques may describe how to provide alternate ways for visitors to get content. Alternative content, files, and formats must also conform to WSG and meet relevant success criteria, thereby becoming sustainable.</p>
					<p>The code examples in the techniques are intended to demonstrate only the specific point discussed in the technique. They might not demonstrate best practices for other aspects of sustainability, accessibility, usability, or coding not related to the technique. They are not intended to be copied and used as the basis for developing web content.</p>
					<p>Many techniques point to "working examples" that are more robust and may be appropriate for copying and integrating into web content.</p>

								<p>This technique is <strong>Advisory</strong> to meet <em>Success Criteria</em> within <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#undertake-systemic-impacts-mapping">2.1 Undertake Systemic Impacts Mapping</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Create a maintainable list of different variables that may impact the sustainability of a product or service over time. By having this list in place, everyone in the creation process can closely monitor the application or website against each variable to determine if an PPP variable present on the list will require resolution either before, during, or after a product or service is launched.</p>
								<p>This list should be created during ideation if possible but can also be machine-generated from a pre-determined list of known PPP factors using evidence and research. The content of this material could be further tested through automation if such variables can be aligned with product capabilities however at a bare minimum, this list must be publicly visible (such as within a sustainability statement) and utilized in-house to enact sustainable change.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://websitesustainability.com/cache/files/variables.pdf">The Variables of Website Sustainability</a> provides a comprehensive map of the various carbon traps that exist on the Internet.

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism so that websites and applications can offer contingency processes for visitors who have constraints such as an older device, an out-of-date operating system, an unusual or out-of-date browser, or a slow Internet connection. Other contingencies exist (such as geo-blocking or mobile data costs) and these can also be taken into account if detection is possible. Each of these issues can burden the user-experience and cause added conflict along the pipeline in terms of emissions.</p>
								<p>If detection is not available (such as in cases where the Internet is unavailable), Non-digital investigation should be conducted where possible (such as through the use of mail or telephone feedback). Once the constraint has been detected, it will often be up to the developer to create a solution that will involve compatibility features or reducing the load on the visitor's device to increase ease of access.

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Reduce the cognitive load for visitors between the initial visit to a website or application and reaching their final destination where the information they are seeking is located. The path to locating such information can be routed through multiple interactions such as a search mechanism, hyperlinks, form controls (where appropriate), and progressive disclosure features (reducing the complexity involved in reaching a destination will reduce the rendering load leading to sustainability benefits).</p>
								<p>While there is no hard and fast rule regarding the number of clicks required to meet a visitor's expectations, including clear way-finding (breadcrumbs can be machine-identified as can landing page regions to guide visitors along the path). It is therefore a sensible precaution to ensure that the steps required are well documented to avoid overwhelming a visitor. If required, click-through testing can be measured to identify bottlenecks in complex applications.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>While the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/3-click-rule/">three-click rule</a> is a false heuristic, employing common navigation patterns within a header or footer can help visitors traverse a product when multiple click-throughs are necessary to reach a destination faster.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Ensure that visitors can read the materials produced for your website or application and click on interactive content (such as links or buttons) that would otherwise be impaired by other content that due to positioning obscures the material by preventing the page from functioning correctly (wasted clicks, especially if JavaScript functions monitor them could lead to emission costs so its best to avoid unnecessary actions).</p>
								<p>There will be occasions when content should be obscured to progressively disclose additional content, but for unintentional overlapping, obscuring deliberately for attention (unnecessary), and all cases where the visitor did not ask to be impacted, the visibility of the content should be assured (either manually or mechanically through identifying object locations and dimensions plus where conflicts arise, issue remedial advice).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Advertising is often a cause of content that temporarily overlaps content with the intent of requesting clicks or attention-grabbing to monetize the material on the website or application. While such actions may be financially reasoned, they are rarely sustainably minded.</li>
									<li>Consent managers are an example of obscuring materials for the good as they ensure that visitors to the page authorize potentially invasive technologies before they become active. An example of this is the cookie consent banner that asks for their allowance before they can be used to store sensitive information on the visitor's machine.</li>
									<li>Scrollable content in which the scrollbar has been obscured, replaced (with a non-functional, obscured, or hidden replacement), or hidden entirely making it impossible to detect where additional content may occur beyond just the window (such as in overflowing boxes) will be unavailable to visitors making its use of hardware to render a waste of resources.</li>

								<p>This technique is <strong>Advisory</strong> to meet <em>Success Criteria</em> within <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#create-a-lightweight-experience-by-default">2.6 Create a Lightweight Experience by Default</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Help increase the readability of content within a website or application by breaking down larger pieces of content into smaller constituent pieces. In the same way that a book is broken down into chapters, using progressive disclosure you can reveal sections when the reader is ready, avoiding information overload (the same can be done with long tasks).</p>
								<p>For machine testability, identification of such progressive disclosure markers can be found using the HTML details or dialog element, the CSS target selector (and its accompanying HTML ID attributes), the CSS checkbox hack, the use of JavaScript HashBangs, and also the use of state (and content) changes through various frameworks. Each of these can build a picture of how content displays on-screen during the user-experience, and some can load content only when it is requested which can reduce data transfer and rendering requests leading to sustainability improvements.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Tabs can be a simple way in which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays">you can showcase</a> different pieces of information to an audience. By using a mechanism such as the CSS target selector you can reveal information based on its related HTML ID.</li>

It's important to question the acceptability of such usage for example, opening links in new windows may be acceptable for non-web formats like PDF, otherwise, it's best to advise against its use.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>While not as common today, popup advertisements which appear in a new window or in a separate frame used to be a fixture of the early web and required heavy visitor management to close multiple banners that would trigger.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check for CSS and JavaScript overlays that may occur onLoad and remove when identified.</li>
									<li>Check that any popup events can only be initiated with the visitor's consent.</li>
									<li>Check all hyperlinks for new window opening triggers (and action as appropriate).</li>

							<div class="note" title="About This Technique">
								<p><strong>Applicability</strong></p>
								<p>This technique is <strong>Advisory</strong> to meet <em>Success Criteria</em> within <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#avoid-unnecessary-or-an-overabundance-of-assets">2.7 Avoid Unnecessary or an Overabundance of Assets</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism in which visitors can reduce their impact by choosing to have a more basic experience (to what extent will be up to the developer) by downloading fewer external resources, scripts, and other assets to their machine to be processed and rendered. With this action, a website or application that is already optimized for sustainability can go one step further in providing a barebones format for those wishing to prioritize lowering their footprint over having added functionality.</p>
								<p>This action could be performed by defining what assets have been added to the product or service to enhance the experience but are not of critical importance (such as background images, or decorative flourishes that can be machine identified). Other forms of decoration can also be machine-identified such as CSS flourishes to content and images, background sounds, custom cursors, custom scrollbars, etc.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Web browsers can <a href="https://csscursor.info/">change CSS cursors</a>, and while there may be functional reasons to do so under certain circumstances, such as to indicate loading progress, zoom, or click-ability, in most circumstances, you should leave it at the system default as this is the expected behavior.</li>
									<li>CSS scrollbars <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scrollbars_styling">can be customized</a> or replaced but this can be problematic for visitors. Changes in scroll speed or its mechanics can affect impact readability and the way things render, and color changes can impact visibility and affect overflow regions within elements of the page. In such cases, the system default always functions better than a custom solution.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check decorative images are clearly labeled using ARIA so assistive technologies can skip them.</li>
									<li>Check that CSS decoration can be disabled if it may interfere with readability.</li>
									<li>Check that custom scrollbars and cursors can be disabled as they may interfere with a visitor's ability to interact with the screen.</li>
									<li>Check that background sounds can be disabled and do not auto-load or auto-play.</li>
									<li>Check that decorative features can be disabled at the visitor's request.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Verify that your navigation menu is crafted in such a manner that it is both accessible to visitors and user-agents and functions correctly so that when implemented it doesn't lead to issues when attempting to browse the information architecture of a website or application. If the information architecture were to fail, this would lead to PPP failings as your visitors would no longer be able to use the product or service without encountering barriers to access and risk further emissions attempting to solve the issue.</p>
								<p>Machine testing the structure of a navigation menu will usually involve the nav, ul, or ol elements within the header of a product or service which repeats across pages and assuming that links function as expected and click ratios (sizes) are large enough on both desktop and mobile platforms, any search functionality will also need to be tested to ensure that results are provided upon submission.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>The hamburger design is often considered the stereotype of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/11/navigation-design-mobile-ux/">mobile functionality</a>, a three-lined icon that represents a menu upon clicking it reveals a full-screen list of options. Employing good patterns is key to reducing confusion and abandonment from visitors.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Increase the findability of the content within your website among search engines and social networks. By creating a <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> sitemap in the base directory of your website, and potentially having a human-readable) HTML sitemap to supplement it, you provide an index of all the publicly available pages. This acts as a potential signpost for individuals who may find themselves seeking information but not knowing exactly where it is stored.</p>
								<p>When creating an HTML sitemap it will be important to categorize pages into lists based on what section of the website they appear in (for human readability) rather than providing everything in a single long list. Structurally, you could use lists within lists to provide this distinction or use subheadings with individual lists. Both methods should ensure to be semantically correct and accessible to meet the human requirements of PPP targets.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>The <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">Sitemaps protocol</a> showcases a basic XML sitemap format that can be used within the base directory of a website. It is supported by search engines like Google and can be submitted for indexing which can increase findability and potentially help visitors find your product or service quicker.</li>
									<li>An <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/html-sitemap/">HTML sitemap</a> is a more visually organized showcase of the pages publicly available within your product or service. The idea behind it is to be as comprehensive as possible but not to overwhelm the visitor. This might be the ideal place to use a system like progressive disclosure so that you can guide individuals through the materials you provide interactively.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Ensure that visitors and users of an application or website can monitor changes and events that occur over time. The need to be able to track such events is critical as customers become reliant on products and services. This reliance on such features means that time will have been invested into learning how to set up and use the product, which if it fails could have a sustainability impact not just for the product or service owner, but for those reliant on its ability to function.</p>
								<p>Every product or service will have its own update schedule and there will be no hard and fast rule in terms of how often a website or application should be offering new releases. That being said, there should be a mechanism in place to describe news events both in a syndicated format and on the website, and a system status mechanism to identify any current issues with the product or service.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/">Apple has a newsroom</a> that is very minimalistic yet it contains all that you would expect from a news category from a major website. It has grouped stories with useful headlines, dates, categories, and a picture. Having something similar for your website can help visitors find new material quickly and reduce churn digging through archives.</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/feed/">Syndication feeds</a> come in multiple different formats but the most common is the <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification"><abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> format</a>. They are compatible with readers on every platform and can be a useful way to get news to subscribers quickly. While these make regular requests to websites, they request less data and result in visitors spending less time browsing overall which is an emissions-positive event.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check for a news page or category of a website.</li>
									<li>Check the news section has been updated within 12 months.</li>
									<li>Check for a syndication feed in RSS, Atom, or <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>.</li>
									<li>Check the syndication feed has been updated within 12 months.</li>
									<li>Check for other syndicated events (podcasts, <abbr title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</abbr>, etc).</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Use the least amount of permission requests required to achieve a given task. Allowing the visitor to control when they receive information is critically important but it's also important not to burden them with requests to access hardware or do things that might prove invasive (such as triggering notifications or a pop-up window).</p>
								<p>For mechanical testability, JavaScript APIs can check using methods such as requestPermission() to identify if a website or application has been granted access to use various hardware or potentially abusable features within the web browser. Unsubscribe, and delete / freeze account links could also be identified (with internal access being granted).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Cookie notification messages are required by law (the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Cookie Directive) and could be identified by a script. These are heavily featured within websites and allow visitors to prioritize privacy over the availability of functionality assuming that they are implemented correctly.</li>
									<li>Customizing or removing functionality within applications can help simplify the workflow of a visitor and increase the productivity within an interface (which will have sustainability benefits as it could reduce the weight from unnecessary features loading and visitors spending less time at the screen).</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check which permissions from the available APIs are being granted.</li>
									<li>Check if products or services have unsubscribe / account freezing and removal options.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Lower the barriers to entry with content. When dealing with complex, multi-page websites it becomes increasingly important to have features in place to allow visitors to bypass repeated elements that they have already prefilled to achieve goals quicker (this is a key variable for sites who have large membership numbers).</p>
								<p>There are functional ways to increase the flow through a website and allow visitors to accomplish a task that can also be machine-testable. This technique is most useful when dealing with complex pieces of content, multi-step products, or services that have a lot of functionality that may require shortcuts to allow faster decision-making under certain conditions.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://goodlinks.app/">Read-It-Later</a> software may be provided by third-parties but they allow for both offline access to content on a variety of platforms and customization of the materials visually based on the visitor's requirements.</li>
									<li>Quick purchase features (such as Amazon's famous "Buy Now" button) allow for the immediate purchase of a product, skipping past the shopping basket steps and using prior purchase knowledge to reduce friction.</li>
									<li>Shortcut links and patterns can be used to skip ahead or over information and / or pages when it is recognized that the information may not be relevant or required in a multi-step process (such as form filling).</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Allow the visitor to achieve the task they initially set out to do and not trigger unnecessary issues in the user-experience which would undermine their ability to complete the said task. Issues such as infinite scrolling can promote a need for continued browsing (which can load excessive data and have a sustainability impact on rendering) and loading overlays that deviate visitors from their path will have wider societal impacts on PPP targets which need to be considered.</p>
								<p>Within this technique, machine testability can be considered by examining if common link pagination landmarks (previous, next, &lt;numbers&gt;, etc) exist within category listings and if overlays or attention-keeping features are detected for common patterns (such as those mentioned in the examples below). If screen addition mechanisms are determined to be in use within a website, this should be considered a failing mark against the related success criteria.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Sale promotional overlays are a common theme that displays upon loading a page and requests the visitor take notice of them before dismissing them to view the content they want to examine.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Use repeating patterns that visitors are likely to recognize from visits to other websites to build a sense of comfort and identification with your products and services. By using established design patterns that are repeatable, recognizable, and testable, you can reduce the amount of confusion likely to occur within a user-interface and this will increase the speed of adaptability (which has sustainability benefits).</p>
								<p>It should be noted that for machine testability, heuristic recognition (identification of patterns in code) will likely allow product creators to recognize the implementation of certain patterns, especially when libraries or design systems are utilized as the backbone of a product or service. Through this, recommendations can be made to improve layouts.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>A website layout could follow a <a href="https://htmlburger.com/blog/website-layout-ideas/">conventional design pattern</a> aimed at a recognized reading flow such as the F or Z pattern. They are based on established scientific studies of how people first identify and then read content on a screen.

									<li><a href="https://ui-patterns.com/patterns">Individual components</a> that aim to be repeatable conventions across products and services can take many forms (some are often provided as third-party services due to the build complexity involved) and should aim to be visually recognizable even if stylistic differences occur for branding which will help reduce wasted screen time.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Identify whether the images you are using are firstly necessary (which may be difficult to machine test), and secondly are using a format that is web appropriate. While these considerations may seem small they can dramatically lead to performance benefits that can reduce loading times and page bloat (which is an increasing issue on today's Internet).</p>
								<p>Implementations should consider in necessity the total image count (too many over a certain ratio could be problematic for those with bandwidth limits). Machine testability for web graphics can easily detect older formats that should be replaced immediately, formats that could potentially be changed for optimization purposes, and formats that could become vector graphics.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Certain image formats perform better than others, <abbr title="AV1 Image File Format">AVIF</abbr> and WebP will (in most cases) have better optimization rates than the original three classics for the web (<abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>, <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>) and should be considered by default.</li>
									<li>Different devices have different breakpoints, but these shouldn't be used as hard and fast rules for every situation as there are far too many devices out there to be compatible with. It makes better sense (if serving a single image) to default to the mid-range of the average device you receive.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Tests</strong></p>
								<p>Procedure</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Check the image density of the page and flag pages over a certain image count.</li>
									<li>Check for older image format usage (<abbr title="Bitmap">BMP</abbr> / <abbr title="Tagged Image File Format">TIFF</abbr>) and require replacement.</li>
									<li>Check for PNG and JPEG images and flag potential upgrades to AVIF or WebP.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Ensure that images are not only served at the correct resolution and size for the device requesting them but also to make sure that the images being served have been compressed using a suitable algorithm to provide the asset at the lowest bandwidth requirements possible to the visitor, thereby improving multiple PPP variables and increasing performance.</p>
								<p>Compression tests can be run against every image to see if improvements can be made (above and beyond changing formats) without losing too much image quality that visibility becomes degraded and therefore a recognition issue.

								<p>While it is preferable that only links below the fold have HTML lazy-loading attributes attached to them, there does not appear to be a penalty for including it within all images so if machine testing cannot differentiate this shouldn't be discriminated against as a failing point. Additionally, the point of the fold can change based on the type of device being used so it's worth considering this into processes.</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Ensure that media will only run within a website or application on the command of the visitor and not begin consuming resources and thrashing hardware from the immediacy of the page load event. Because this involves HTML (attributes and background media), JavaScript, and images (animated <abbr title="Graphic Interchange Format">GIFs</abbr>), a multi-functional approach is required.</p>
								<p>Because media can involve audio and video, implementors will need to ensure that both are treated with equal respect as they both consume resources and contribute to emissions (to varying degrees).

								<p><strong>Applicability</strong></p>
								<p>This technique is <strong>Advisory</strong> to meet <em>Success Criteria</em> within <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-media-assets">2.16 Take a More Sustainable Approach to Media Assets</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism that ensures visitors remain in control of when highly impactful (in terms of emissions) media or third-party materials begin to transmit to their devices. By having a static facade that upon clicking begins the render (and not simply hiding the video, audio or interactive element behind the static image), you ensure that the content has a lazy-load effect even if autoplay or the interaction is not active (as pre-buffering may occur during the render process).</p>
								<p>Because there is no browser default method for facades (at the time of publication), identification of such events for machine testability will come down to them being clearly labeled using ID or class attributes (or through heuristic testing for an image that is either anchor linked or has a button attached with a JavaScript event handler to process the content switch).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Jason Knight has provided some <a href="https://codepen.io/jason-knight/pen/OJBjgNQ">simple but useful examples</a> of his own implementation of accessible HTML video facades which he developed as a solution to the performance (and sustainability) issues media can cause.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Determine if animation usage within an application or website will diminish the user-experience. By calculating the number of animations that occur and identifying if this number firstly can be reduced and then running each of them individually and identifying if they cause lagging on lower specification devices, offering a resolution will help reduce the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> and <abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> burden which can consume vast visitor resources.</p>
								<p>It should be noted that the types of animations used can dramatically affect the rendering process. Certain CSS transitions and animations are more process efficient than others, and JavaScript animation can also have differing impacts on CSS in both the choice of animation and how it has been put together. This should be considered when testing to offer low-impact animations and effects.</p>

								<p>Multiple variables will contribute to the size of a typeface, as such, it is difficult to simply specify a hard number to aim for, but if (for example) you aren't using international characters and you can subset your font, eliminating such waste could save precious resources from the fonts character table and reduce the file size considerably (reducing the system resource load upon rendering).</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Reduce the amount of inteference that occurs when information is required to be entered on a form control within a user-interface. Identify how many elements must be filled out (and those which are not mandatory being eliminated), clearly label how such components need to be filled out (and how many steps there are), plus have links to data collection policies.</p>
								<p>Such actions can lead to less unnecessary data transmission which is not only beneficial in terms of privacy and security (the people and societal component of PPP) but also having fewer form elements or steps to render will have an emissions reduction due to the lower amount of individual elements to render to the screen (and the visitor will spend less time on-screen filling the forms in).</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism within forms during necessary data entry to allow automated tooling to provide necessary assistance. Such data entry will cause visitors to spend less time onscreen and as such will generate fewer emissions in addition to less frustration from failed attempts that would otherwise lead to potential escalation of such emissions being triggered (while also conserving bandwidth).</p>
								<p>For machine testability, the autocomplete attribute should be disabled in all form inputs outside of those likely to be utilized / assisted by a password manager (this is especially true where the suggestions do not come from a visitor device but a third-party and additional bandwidth or rendering processes are likely to be endured). A list of such inputs can be identified from a common password manager and marked against each form for correctness.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><a href="https://www.grammarly.com/signin">Login forms such as Grammerly</a> can be detected by password manager software and therefore have a benefit for autocompletion (as visitors cannot be expected to remember personal details across all websites).</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.jotform.com/form-templates/job-application">Filling in an application form</a> should allow autocomplete for elements of a profile that may be contained within a password manager (such as name, email, and phone), but should be disabled in all other formats to prevent the text element from attempting to anticipate the visitor's responses.</li>
									<li>The HTML Hell advent calendar has a <a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/autocompleting-password-fields/">great article on providing autocomplete</a> for the sake of third-party tooling access such as password managers.

This technique is most useful when performed with each major milestone as there is a potential for feature (and compliance) breaking material to occur.</p>
								<p>Within the scope of sustainability, this is increasingly important as there are explicit laws surrounding the subject in addition to expanded PPP remits such as accessibility, privacy, etc. In terms of machine testability the mechanics of an implementation may be more difficult than utilizing an automated checker, but wizard software can work through questions to help identify key issues.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Internationally reaching environmental legislation such as <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en"><abbr title="Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive">CSRD</abbr></a> and the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240112IPR16772/meps-adopt-new-law-banning-greenwashing-and-misleading-product-information">Green Claims Directive</a> provide stricter enforcement around product descriptions and the need to reduce emissions and accurately report such efforts.</li>
									<li>Accessibility legislation (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/">of which there are many worldwide</a>) provides strict enforcement around ensuring inclusivity not just offline but also in the digital sphere as well, leaving non-compliance open to lawsuit risks.</li>
									<li>Internationally reaching privacy legislation such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></a> can also impact digital services on a sustainability level (through the people and societal aspect of PPP), and <a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist/">various</a> <a href="https://gdprchecklist.io/">checklists</a> can assist.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Identify a web application that exists and then determine if turning the web application into a progressive web application would be more beneficial than providing a native offering.

								<p>Machine testability can firstly examine the existing state of an application to determine how sustainable it is and what technology stack was used to develop it (and how sustainable it already performs for all), from there, data points can be used to identify an approximate cost of implementation for both a native or highly optimized web application endpoint and options can be provided.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Native applications may be a good choice if applications require specific access to hardware as Web APIs can still be quite restrictive. In addition, there is a case for going native to provide a more <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>-centric look and feel.</li>
									<li>Web applications are often quicker and easier to deploy and can provide updates without delays in the pipeline (as they don't have to go through store controls), they can also benefit from lower creation costs.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>First identify any third-party components within a website or application, then analyze that feature as if it were a first-party product or service (against the WSGs) for sustainability. If the product or service is determined to be highly impactful in a negative way, the third-party should be replaced or removed; otherwise, it can be optimized, or stay as-is.</p>
								<p>As third-party components are hosted externally, machine testing these elements should involve isolating these components and testing them as separate from the product or service. This can be factored into any decision-making regarding inclusion as highly performant and sustainable third-party materials will ultimately be low impact (and the opposite is true for others).</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism to delay third-party content from loading to the screen until the visitor has requested it. Because third-party content is sourced from outside the origin domain, the sustainability impacts of the third-party code are outside of the control of a project, and thus click-to-load delay screens using the import-on-interaction pattern is critical.</p>
								<p>The pattern used to either switch in the third-party content or load it on-demand can be machine-identified and if common third-party library resources are identified as loading (or leaking) upon a visit, this can and should be flagged up as a failure of the success criteria in functioning upon the visitor request (as such external requests should be within the visitor control).</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Identify the location of website content and determine the most suitable pathway for it to be consumed sustainably. With the rise in content being hosted on third-party blogging platforms, there is a risk of significant content loss if the platform disappears and therefore a need for self-hosting exists (especially to maintain control of sustainability impacts).</p>
								<p>For machine testability, identifying the source of the content is a key priority, then determining the impact of any third-party (the risk of content loss along with any sustainability impacts through WSG testing).

								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide mechanisms to assist the visitor with finding and navigating through content within the page or application. This can come in the form of links that allow you to bypass blocks of content, which is especially useful when large vocal areas of navigation or other content exist. It could also be in the form of keyboard shortcuts that activate certain features within a complex application rather than having to click multiple steps.</p>
								<p>Machine testability for such features can identify events within JavaScript or features that use common patterns in code that are recognized as helpful signposting features. If such features are present then the success criteria can be marked as compliant but if none are found it could be an indicator, especially in complex websites or applications that such features are needed.</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide the necessary metadata within the head of your website or application to ensure that search engines can index your content correctly. You can use several different mechanisms to achieve this as several different formatting schemes have been provided over the years and they have varying levels of support by different search providers.</p>
								<p>To enhance the findability of your content (which will reduce time being wasted by visitors trying to locate you), having a well-formatted series of metadata is critical. As such, testing should focus on determining whether basic meta tags are used or if another format is being used to serve data. Once detected, identify if the tags are recognized, if they aren't in common use or have been deprecated by a provider, it's worth requesting removal for the data savings.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>

While there are many ways to approach this task, this technique is focused on connection speeds and the potential window size.</p>
								<p>Because connection speeds can vary based on a whole range of factors (and cannot be aligned with averages due to location, mobile vs home, connection quality, etc), multiple speed ranges should be machine tested against. The same can be said for window sizes as while resolutions are common to certain devices, browsers can be resized, and unusual device types do also exist therefore CSS fluid scaling and visual breakpoints should be utilized.</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Identify any deprecated code that is no longer recommended for use within specifications. As older code is often not as highly optimized for performance (browser makers often cease to maintain abandoned and deprecated features), it can take longer to render and thrash hardware causing higher emissions so as a general rule, is worth resolving.</p>
								<p>For machine testability, deprecations in languages can also be found within specifications from providers like the W3C. Documentation providers like MDN also provide extremely thorough coverage of syntax that has been deprecated such as within HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If replacements for any techniques can be offered, provide them, otherwise recommend removal from your code.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism for websites and applications to ensure that content is cached for the correct length of time, with the intention of reusability.

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism to serve content correctly using a recognized encoding method to reduce the payload size of websites and applications. While this means there will be an additional rendering effort on the client-side (decoding the file), the increased speed in loading such files has an PPP benefit that justifies the added effort.</p>
								<p>For machine testability, identifying content encoding methods for file formats can be done by checking the content-encoding headers for various files as they are requested from the server. This can be achieved on an individual basis or through server configuration files. If the content is not being encoded (unless it has been encoded at the source and no further optimization can be made), recommendations can be made to use a compatible compression technique.</p>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism for if and when visitors land on a region of your website or application that either does not exist or appears to be broken. Such encounters can be disorientating and without useful signposting and interactions to get visitors out of such events, additional unnecessary page loads or support requests can occur leading to emissions.</p>
								<p>Machine testing for errors can simply involve triggering the events and identifying if the page loaded in response is one that is server-generated or one that has been customized by the website or application. If it has been customized does it provide useful resources to help resolve the problem? This could be measured using analytics (which may require internal access).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>HubSpot has <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33766/10-clever-website-error-messages-from-creative-companies.aspx">some great examples</a> of 404 (page not found) error pages showcasing good user-experience design in addition to providing a few helpful pieces of advice regarding how they should function.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Reduce the amount of wasted rendering effort on the part of visitors and users of a website or application by ensuring that products and services regularly and routinely check that all of the links within pages are correct and do not need to be updated. This can be a common issue amongst large sites or those with older content (as the material can be moved or disappear online), so links must be updated to reflect this).</p>
								<p>Regarding machine testability, verifying that all links within domains and subdomains of a product or service are correctly linked to and don't resolve in redirect notices or server / missing (not found) errors is essential for meeting this success criterion as it showcases the currency of the content. It should also be noted that links apply equally to images, media, HTML head references, and other materials referenced within the page, not just content anchor links.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Open source products like <a href="https://github.com/linkchecker/linkchecker">Link Checker</a> can verify the status of references across multiple pages. This can be a quick and easy way of locating issues that have built up across an entire product or service.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism for identifying compromised content within a page of a website or application. As having a secure product or service is critical to meeting the societal (people) aspect of PPP and compromised websites can place unnecessary burdens on hardware in certain circumstances, being able to identify and remove such materials is essential.</p>
								<p>Machine testability for these events will require regular monitoring of pages for common features of hijacking events such as critical links suddenly redirecting outside of the primary domain, pages being redesigned with hacking notices, or simply being taken down and replaced with other data.

								<p>Ensure that mechanisms are in place to hold data for only as long as it is required. This will reduce redundancy from things like stale cookies, and it will also assist older devices that may have lower capacity disk space allowances by reducing the overall size of caches which will free up important space (that otherwise reduces performance).</p>
								<p>Identifying technologies for stashing data for a set time such as cookies, local databases, or other methods can be machine-tested. It's also worth identifying techniques that may be slower performing and making recommendations based on such implementations. Otherwise, verify that an expiry date does exist and if time has elapsed (or no date exists), flag the issue.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Cookies are a classic example of data stored for a particular reason, but if they are left unchecked, accumulate in vast numbers. While they don't take up a lot of space, they still should be purged if no longer required.</li>

								<p>This technique is <strong>Advisory</strong> to meet <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#consider-cdns-and-edge-caching">4.10 Consider CDNs and Edge Caching</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Prevent non-first-party dynamic resources from being loaded through a content delivery network. The justification behind this is due to browser mechanisms such as CORS and cache partitioning, unfavorable things can occur if you try to load dynamic resources from third-party websites (this is a security measure to prevent malicious code injection).</p>
								<p>As this issue doesn't affect static resources such as HTML, CSS, or JSON, when testing against the criteria, these types of resources can be excluded. For more dynamic resources like JavaScript or server-side code, if the host URL differs from your own (this includes things like frameworks), flagging up an error and recommending self-hosting or integration with existing tooling should be done.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>While D3 is a well-respected JavaScript framework for producing graphs and complex charts. <a href="https://d3js.org/getting-started">It has a recommendation</a> for vanilla HTML users that states a preference for a CDN package (going against our guidelines).</li>
									<li><a href="https://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> is another JavaScript framework that offers CDN packages while also offering direct download options. In this case, the download option is provided first (and code examples reflect this) which is good.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a mechanism that ensures all content within a website or application gets regularly reviewed and if necessary refreshed, updated, or if it has reached the end-of-life, deleted or archived. As such, publicly providing a date when events will occur should offer an incentive for providers to action these labels (and visitors can note outdated content).</p>
								<p>Machine testability should offer a grace period for content that has passed the date when a review should take place (as circumstances can lead to dates being missed), however, failings should still be flagged as potential issues that need to be resolved.

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Ensure that any third-party backup service provider is examined for sustainability impacts. This will involve examining the impact they have simply in hosting your data, but also how sustainable their platform is, as well as their business. If their model meets any obligations laid out and aligns well against the WSGs, it may meet success criteria.</p>
								<p>To identify how sustainable a service is, a list of recommended sustainable backup providers would be an ideal source to utilize (assuming that one exists and it is itself reputable). If no list exists, checking providers' claims, sustainability statements, and measuring their service against criteria such as the WSGs can be helpful to some extent, though utilizing established standards like the <abbr title="Global Reporting Initiative">GRI</abbr> and recommendations around infrastructure will also help.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>

								<p>This technique is <strong>Advisory</strong> to meet <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#support-mandatory-disclosures-and-reporting">5.9 Support Mandatory Disclosures and Reporting</a>.</p>
								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Provide a simple mechanism to identify what reporting scheme a business may operate under (such as GRI), or if they have any available guidance regarding disclosing and reporting sustainability outside of their sustainability statement. This may come under some publicly available policy documents, or it may require internal access to locate the data.</p>
								<p>The important step in this process is to scan through the pages of the site to identify every policy page and flag any that relate to disclosures or reporting (that mention sustainability). These will be key references that if they do not have good information architecture could be hard for the visitor to find. If such policies exist, ensure they are referenced within the sustainability statement.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>The <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/how-to-use-the-gri-standards/gri-standards-english-language/">Global Reporting Initiative</a> is a recognized standard that individuals may choose to use because of the lack of cost attached to access. It's also widely respected and can be used for conformance with legislation.</li>
									<li>The <a href="https://www.iso.org/sdg">International Standards Organization</a> has provided several standards that can help with disclosure reporting and alignment with conformance to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Ensure that policy decisions match up to regulatory and compliance targets for businesses and individuals aiming to become sustainable. By ensuring that you not only report your existing carbon emissions but also how you plan to reduce any remaining emissions (and be transparent with the public on this matter), you encourage trust in your brand.</p>
								<p>For machine testability, these reports should be linked to from within the sustainability statement on your public-facing website, and if possible in an open format such as HTML (otherwise, an accessible PDF format should be used). Remember that such documents should be regularly maintained if new information that is important to your sustainability journey should come to light.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>Hilton offers an <a href="https://esg.hilton.com/our-progress/">interesting infographic approach</a> to carbon reporting by taking the essential information about how they have made reductions and lay it out in an PPP format (their evidence is available in table format).</li>

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Encourage transparency and visibility around the shift to sustainability for products and services. By actively seeking reports that have to be submitted for compliance reasons (and verifying the data if using an open standard), we can more easily monitor how well a business or individual is meeting their obligations and reaching any targets.</p>
								<p>Because certain content within disclosure documentation may be confidential, internal access for tooling may be required if the organization in question is unwilling to provide a publicly visible anonymized version that will still offer the same useful public data (for those interested). If the data is available, this can be used within monitoring tools to track compliance checkpoints over time.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>A product that creates CSRD reports using a wizard-style interface submits that information as part of a package of data to a service that tests for sustainability and this gets added to the evidence gathering.</li>

								<p>For machine testability, first examine that the agreement exists and that it can be easily understood (many policy documents can be written in legalese so having a plain English version should be a priority), testing tools can also identify key passages that could be highlighted as requirements for their particular needs (such as timeframes for coverage or exclusionary features).</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>PandaDoc has a simple <a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/software-maintenance-agreement-template/">software maintenance agreement template</a> that could be used in cases where money is potentially being exchanged.

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Verify that the product or service has a proven track record of iterating over its lifetime. Naturally, the quality of the iteration (whether those changes have been improvements) will be more difficult to quantify, however, the fact that a product or service is active and being maintained is usually a good indicator of sustainable development.</p>
								<p>Machine testing for the iteration record is easier with open source projects as a timestamped record is usually available through the repository provider, of which you can analyze the code for impactful issues. If such access is not possible, archival or caching tools for websites can help provide a useful record of iteration over time and may (using a DIFF tool) showcase iterative alterations.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

								<p>Each product or service should have an associated set of release notes that should be regularly maintained, as such, version numbers within those notes should match the version number of the available versions of the product or service. In addition, release notes should be detailed and sectioned based on criteria such as additions, removals, changes, and fixes - not just a single bullet that offers little context.

								<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
								<p>Offer a mechanism for users of a product or service to allow the management of any information (data) or accounts (subscription or otherwise) they may hold. Best practices with such systems will include allowing the deletion of accounts and / or data without human intervention and providing single steps (with confirmation) to achieve this.</p>
								<p>Machine testing such features will undoubtedly require internal access for a product or service, however, if the ability to create an account can be automated or undertaken, then the visibility of the source code within the account management system can be verified by tooling. As such, where internal access is required, gain permission, then check for the ability to delete accounts (and verify that this action works), if it does, pass the check.</p>
								<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li>A Software as a Service provider has within the account manager, a profile section allowing customers to click a big red button to "delete account and data". Upon hitting confirm, this erases their details from the servers.</li>

If the business in question is supportive of open source, this should also be noted publicly.</p>
								<p>Identifying an open source license should be straightforward, especially if the product or service utilizes a public repository system like GitHub.

			<h2>Test Suite</h2>
			<p><a>Interoperability</a> is important to web professionals. Better interoperability among implementations means that web professionals can create websites, applications, and tooling designed to be sustainable, and ensure that it is successfully repeatable (and testable) in several environments. It means reducing the potential for Web sustainability issues to occur in complex projects and reducing the implementation time where automation and tooling can assist during the creation, development, and maintenance process. Writing tests in a way that allows them to be run in all browsers gives implementors confidence that they are shipping software that will be compatible, and consistent with other implementations.</p>
			<p>Good test suites drive interoperability. They are a key part of making sure web standards are implemented correctly and consistently. More tests encourage more interoperability. Wrong tests drive interoperability on wrong behavior. As such, Web Sustainability needs good test suites. It's an evolving field and most of the test suites are still works in progress: so they may contain errors.</p>
			<p>The primary focus of this test suite is to provide interoperability for tool makers (in terms of automation and compliance with the WSGs). In addition, we also aim to provide meaningful testable metrics that can be measured and help identify the true impact of the Success Criteria within the WSGs, and therefore better understand the impact that digital has on the ecosystem.</p>
			<p>Implementors could use the dataset provided to expand upon the results and offer more nuanced research. Additionally, there is the potential for toolmakers to create more accurate products that measure the carbon impact of products. While the scope of such matters may potentially stretch beyond this group's remit, the results could feed back into - and impact further iterations of our work.</p>

				<p>If attempting to create a test to include within or expand the test suite, remember to follow these <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/reviewing-tests/checklist.html">review guidelines</a> and be considerate that our tests follow the <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/test/format">formatting structure</a> of tests created for the CSS Working Group (for interoperability as well as convenience). For an indication of how tests should be structured, use our documented <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/blob/main/test-suite/_template.html">template test</a> as a starting point.</p>
				<p>Also, be sure to remember that qualitative as well as quantitative tests are equally valuable as long as they can be tested by machine (and thus automated in some way). As tests will provide a means of identifying whether Success Criteria can offer Automated testing over Manual interventions, notifications of this potential attribute (and methods) will be referenced within the main specification.</p>

				<dt>Commissioner</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The person, team of people, organization, in-house department, or other entity that commissioned the evaluation. In many cases the evaluation commissioner may be the website owner or website developer, in other cases it may be another entity.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Conformance</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Evaluator</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The person, team of people, organization, in-house department, or other entity responsible for carrying out the evaluation.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><dfn>Interoperability</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Interoperability is the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Web page</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Web page state</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Dynamically generated web pages sometimes provide significantly different content, functionality, and appearance depending on the user, interaction, device, and other parameters. In the context of this methodology such web page states can be treated as ancillary to web pages (recorded as an additional state of a web page in a web page sample) or as individual web pages.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Website</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A coherent collection of one or more related web pages that together provide common use or functionality. It includes static web pages, dynamically generated web pages, and mobile websites and applications.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Website developer</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The person, team of people, organization, in-house department, or other entity that is involved in the website development process including but not limited to content authors, designers, front-end developers, back-end programmers, quality assurance testers, and project managers.</p>
