The benefits of this are that emissions will be reduced due to an experience not making assumptions or developing unnecessary features (wasting resources), and being more specific about how you might reduce a product or service's environmental impact.",
							"Privacy": "Assessing the needs of visitors will help you comply with privacy laws like GDPR, and anonymous analytics alongside test data can also be used to improve privacy.",
							"Social Equity": "Improved user-experience often means products or services work better for visitors on older devices, in low-bandwidth environments, those with older devices, those in restrictive countries, those who speak different languages, and those with other potential barriers to accessing content. This reduces emissions as less e-waste will be produced if the need for newer equipment becomes less of a priority.",
							"Accessibility": "Understanding the needs of your visitors through accessibility and trauma-informed research will help you prioritize which inclusive design improvements need to be implemented to enhance an already accessible product or service.",
							"Performance": "Identifying what visitors require through research and analytics will reduce the potential for technical debt along the product's lifespan, which will help reduce emissions as developers will spend less time building a product with unnecessary features. It can also be used to identify bottlenecks in the user-experience that are causing visitor abandonment. Fixes can be measured and tested against each other, and the benefits of improvements can result in fewer emissions.",
							"Economic": "Knowing your audience has financial benefits, as they are more likely to purchase your product or service if it meets their requirements. Quantitative data analysis can identify potential cost savings by reducing data payload sizes where optimizations can be made.",
							"Conversion": "If a product matches an audience's requirements, they will be likely to use it regularly and this will increase its popularity and gain trust, word of mouth, and social standing."

By avoiding them, you will give those with accessibility needs justification to trust your brand. Furthermore, avoiding unsustainable or carbon-intensive implementations will prevent making any existing situations worse.",

This uses additional energy as they try to find a solution onsite, elsewhere, or give up entirely. Using ethical, non-disruptive coding practices will speed up interactions within your website.",

							"Environmental": "Consistent interfaces that employ web standards require less energy and resources across the product ecosystem, as they are usually tightly optimized.

Building design features with accessibility baked in by default reduces the potential that people with accessibility requirements will be left out during the website or application's lifecycle.",

This will inherently reduce emissions considerably through the building of sustainable patterns.",
							"Economic": "Because of their use of standardized components and their avoidance of redundancy, design systems reduce costs as the development time may be reduced (even accounting for the maintenance time involved in having one). Also, familiar-looking websites that can be browsed with ease are likely to suffer lower bounce rates (where visitors just give up) due to the ease of transition (unlike a unique-looking website which can make navigation increasingly complex).",
							"Conversion": "Design Systems encourage using recognizable components throughout a design, which will help visitors identify and utilize the product or service successfully. As such, this will reduce complaints and annoyance, which can help increase customer retention. Also, user-interface consistency improves visitor trust as individuals will recognize familiar components within your design and know how to utilize them, and this can improve conversion rates as it will lower the rates of abandonment."

					"description": "Compatibility is a critical part of the sustainability mindset and should be prioritized through all products and services. If individuals wish to use older devices (or cannot upgrade due to cost) or do not wish to upgrade as frequently, it will reduce the amount of e-waste that enters the system. If something doesn't work, it's also likely to result in visitors suffering a wasted effort, potentially leading to refused access to your service (and thereby emitting further emissions).",

							"Environmental": "Incompatible websites and applications across the Web encourage people to purchase new devices, which has a giant impact on the environment due to the amount of e-waste it produces. Additionally, planned obsolescence is one of the biggest contributors to e-waste on the planet. Extending the lifespan and improving digital device compatibility within your site's service plan, can improve sustainability and slow the upgrade cycle which results from sluggish digital experiences.",
							"Social Equity": "More compatible products and services that last longer helps to reduce the digital divide, which can be a key issue in cases where income inequality, infrastructure robustness, and other factors play their part (and open your work to new markets). Similarly, because progressive web applications use established web standards, they are available to more people than more cost-prohibitive closed systems (Apple App Store, Google Play, etc).",
							"Accessibility": "The fourth pillar of Accessibility is robustness. By incorporating accessibility into early prototypes, it becomes a priority for project teams throughout a product's lifecycle. Broken source code can also (in specific cases) impact assistive technologies (such as screen readers) and how they can read content to individuals with visual disabilities. Ensuring semantic code can provide an equal, error-free experience to all.",
							"Performance": "Incompatible code has an energy cost, when it's non-standard, deprecated or doesn't work on a device it can take additional time to render as it is usually un-optimized for the environment, which will put pressure on the CPU and waste the consumer's battery. Using modern Web standards will help your website run fast in modern browsers.",
							"Economic": "Product teams benefit from time savings and improved quality, organizations see cost reductions as less refactoring is required due to increased stability, and users benefit from greater trust and potentially lower product costs and maintenance fees as upgrades may not be required as frequently.",
							"Conversion": "More compatible products and services that last longer can potentially increase conversion rates due to the lower rates of abandonment and a wider market audience that can use a barrier-free version of the product or service."
